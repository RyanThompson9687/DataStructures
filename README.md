This repository shows all of the C++ code written for the Data Structures course (COP 4415) at FL Polytechnic University.

The codes are split into assignments and projects, each having .cpp files with the actual code, and a .pdf file with the description of the assignment. 
Assignments are shorter, focusing on one or a few topics. Projects are longer and more involved practice with the topics.

Short descriptions of each are as follows:

Project 1: Stacks

Project 2: Binary Search Trees using an input file

Project 3: Prim Algorithm

Assignment 2: Singly Linked Lists

Assignment 3: Stacks

Assignment 4: Binary Search Trees

Assignmemnt 5: Breadth-First Search, AVL Trees, Binary Heaps, Tries
